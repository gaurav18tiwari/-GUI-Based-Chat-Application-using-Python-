# -GUI-Based-Chat-Application-using-Python-

A GUI based application involves designing a graphical user interface, establishing a client-server connection, defining message formats, implementing message sending and receiving, threading, and error handling.
I have used socket module to build the server client interface
for the desktop application. To send and receive messages simultaneously, threading module is used.
